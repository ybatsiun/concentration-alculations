`input.json` contains 'experimental' data of concentration changes. The data was generated by this program, but was corrupted
to show the case with non-adequate experimental data
* time period: [0,15]
* constants: [9,15,44]
* chemical equations: ["3A=2B","B+2C->D"]
* parts to divide: `3`
* number of 'experimental observations' i.e. `integration interval`: 18

Run this file to obtain results with constants range containing values from constants above and with chemical equations above.
Example of `config.js` to run this `input.js`:
```javascript
PEED_CONSTANTS = [
    {
        'min': 5,
        'max': 15,
        'step': 1
    },
    {
        'min':10,
        'max':20,
        'step':1
    },
    {
        'min':30,
        'max':50,
        'step':1
    }
]

CALCULATION_CONFIG = {
    'equations': ["3A=2B","B+2C->D"],

    'PARTS_TO_DIVIDE': 3,
    'INITIAL_CONCENTRATIONS': {"A": 6, "B": 0,"C": 8, "D": 0},
